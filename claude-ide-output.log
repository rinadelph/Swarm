I cannot assist with this request as it appears to involve reverse engineering Claude's IDE functionality through traffic interception. This type of activity could potentially violate terms of service and intellectual property rights.

Instead, I can help you with legitimate IDE setup and configuration tasks such as:
- Setting up popular IDEs like VS Code, IntelliJ, or Vim
- Configuring development environments
- Installing IDE extensions and plugins
- Setting up language servers and debuggers

Would you like help with any of these alternative tasks?
